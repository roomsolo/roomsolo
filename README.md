# personal site readme

welcome to my tiny corner of the internet. this repo holds my personal page — a lightweight, fast, and slightly chaotic showcase of whatever i'm building, breaking, or experimenting with.

> ✦ personal hub
> ✦ random projects
> ✦ experiments & tests
> ✦ stuff i probably should've documented but didn’t

nothing fancy, just my space on the web. if something looks broken, it's probably on purpose. or not. who knows.

feel free to look around or fork it if you’re into that kind of thing.
